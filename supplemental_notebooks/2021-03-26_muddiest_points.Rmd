## GSEA Visualization

We'll cover some alternate ways to visualize information returned by `GSEA()`.

### Required libraries

```{r libraries}
# Package to run GSEA
library(clusterProfiler)
# Package that contains the MSigDB gene sets in tidy format
library(msigdbr)
# Package for creating a heatmap
library(ComplexHeatmap)
# VST

# Tile plot
library(ggplot2)
```

### Read in differential expression results & expression data

#### Differential expression prep

For this demonstration, we are again going to use the statistics (log2 fold change, specifically) from the neuroblastoma cell line dataset where we compared _MYCN_ amplified to non-amplified cell lines.

```{r read_in_dge}
# Where the DGE results are stored
dge_results_dir <- file.path("..", "RNA-seq", "results", "NB-cell")

# DGE results
dge_results_file <- file.path(
  dge_results_dir,
  "NB-cell_DESeq_amplified_v_nonamplified_results.tsv"
)

# Read in the data
dge_results_df <- readr::read_tsv(dge_results_file)
```

Filter out duplicates by selecting instances of gene symbol with the highest absolute log2 fold change value.

```{r drop_dups}
filtered_dge_df <- dge_results_df %>%
  # Sort so that the highest absolute values of the log2 fold change are at the
  # top
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>%
  # Filter out the duplicated rows using `dplyr::distinct()`
  dplyr::distinct(gene_symbol, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

Get the sorted vector we need to supply to GSEA function.

```{r lfc_vector}
# Vector of log2 fold changes
lfc_vector <- filtered_dge_df %>%
  # Extract a vector of `log2FoldChange` named by `gene_symbol`
  dplyr::pull(log2FoldChange, name = gene_symbol)

# Sort named vector in decreasing order
lfc_vector <- sort(lfc_vector, decreasing = TRUE)
```

#### Transformed RNA-seq data

We'll use the `SummarizedExperiment` for the NB cell line experiment (e.g., output of `tximeta`) to create a `DESeqDataSet` we can transform.
We're going to use the transformed data to make a heatmap.

```{r input-files}
# directory with the tximeta processed data
txi_dir <- file.path("..", "RNA-seq", "data", "NB-cell", "txi")
txi_file <- file.path(txi_dir, "NB-cell_tximeta.RDS")
txi <- readr::read_rds(txi_file)
```

Make a `DESeqDataSet` and perform variance stabilizing transformation ahead of our visualization.

```{r}
ddset <- DESeqDataSet(txi,
                      design = ~ 1)
vst_data <- vst(ddset, blind = TRUE)
```

### Perform GSEA

#### Gene sets

We'll use Hallmark gene sets like we did during instruction.

```{r}
hs_hallmarks_df <- msigdbr(species = "Homo sapiens",
                           category = "H")
```

#### Run GSEA

```{r}
gsea_results <- GSEA(geneList = lfc_vector,  # ordered ranked gene list
                     minGSSize = 25,  # minimum gene set size
                     maxGSSize = 500,  # maximum gene set set
                     pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                     pAdjustMethod = "BH",  # correction for multiple hypothesis testing
                     TERM2GENE = dplyr::select(hs_hallmarks_df,
                                               gs_name,
                                               gene_symbol))
```
Let's get the `result` slot into a data frame so we can more easily use `tidyverse` tools on it.

```{r}
gsea_results_df <- data.frame(gsea_results@result)
```

The `core_enrichment` column contains the genes that are in the leading edge subset of genes for that pathway.
These are the genes that "contribute most to the enrichment result." ([GSEA docs](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm#_Gene_Set_Details_1))

![](diagrams/subramanian_fig1.jpg)

**Figure 1. [Subramanian _et al._ (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506580102).**

Let's look at the _current format_ for these leading edge genes.

```{r}
gsea_results_df %>%
  dplyr::pull(core_enrichment)
```

This could be formatted in a way that is more helpful!
And we probably want to split this information up by whether a pathway has a _positive_ or _negative_ Normalized Enrichment Score (NES).

#### Visualizing Jaccard Index values between leading edge subsets

Let's look at leading edge subsets for pathways with significant negative NES values.
There are many more significant negative pathways than positive pathways, so comparing the leading edge subsets might be more interesting.

First, let's use `tidyr::separate_rows()` to get a data frame where one column is the pathway and one column is gene symbols.

```{r}
# Pathways down in amplified cell lines
neg_gene_pathway_df <- gsea_results_df %>%
  # Only rows that have negative NES
  dplyr::filter(NES < 0) %>%
  # Selected columns: the pathway name or ID, NES, adj p-values, and 
  # leading edge genes
  dplyr::select(ID, core_enrichment) %>%
  # Long format for gene-pathway pairs
  tidyr::separate_rows(core_enrichment, sep = "/") %>%
  # Rename the columns
  dplyr::rename(pathway_id = ID,
                gene = core_enrichment)

neg_gene_pathway_df
```

We can use `split` to turn this data frame into a list where each element of the list is a vector of gene symbols in the leading edge subset and is named for the pathway.

```{r}
neg_leading_list <- split(neg_gene_pathway_df$gene, 
                          neg_gene_pathway_df$pathway_id)
```

The [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) is a measure of similarity between two sets.
The values are bounded between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 indicates perfect overlap.
We can write a custom function to calculate the Jaccard index for two character vectors.

```{r}
calculate_jaccard <- function(x, y) {
  length(intersect(x, y)) / length(union(x, y))
}
```

Let's calculate the Jaccard index between each pair of pathways' leading edge subsets.

```{r}
# Get each pair of pathways
neg_leading_jaccard <- combn(neg_leading_list, 2, simplify = FALSE) %>%
  # Calculate the Jaccard index between the two vectors of leading edge subsets
  purrr::map(~ calculate_jaccard(.x[[1]], .x[[2]])) %>%
  # Return a vector, not a list
  purrr::flatten_dbl()
```

Make into a data frame for plotting with `geom_tile()`.

```{r}
# We'll want to add back in the names of the pathways!
neg_jaccard_df <- data.frame(t(combn(names(neg_leading_list), 2))) %>%  # Get the combination of pathway names
  dplyr::mutate(jaccard_index = neg_leading_jaccard,  # Add jaccard index
                X1 = stringr::str_replace_all(X1, "_", " "),  # Remove underscores from pathway 1 names
                X2 = stringr::str_replace_all(X2, "_", " ")) # Remove underscores from pathway 2 names

neg_jaccard_df
```

Now we'll plot the pairwise Jaccard index values using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
neg_jaccard_df %>%
  # Make a tile plot again, but now use the Jaccard index values for the 
  # fills
  ggplot(aes(x = X1,
             y = X2,
             fill = jaccard_index)) +
  geom_tile() +
  # White-dark green gradient, bounded at 0 and 1 like the metric we are using
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors = c("#FFFFFF", "#006400"),
    limits = c(0, 1),
    name = "Jaccard index"  # What to call it in the legend
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  # Remove the x and y axis labels
  labs(x = NULL, 
       y = NULL,
       # Add a title that's broken up over two lines
       title = "Negative NES Pathway\nLeading Edge Jaccard Index") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.9),
        # Center the plot title and make it bold
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```

#### Heatmap of transformed RNA-seq data for leading edge genes

Now, let's make a heatmap of the transformed values for the genes that are in the leading edge for the "E2F TARGETS" Hallmark gene set.
First, let's get the transformed values into matrix form.

```{r}
# Extract the matrix of VST RNA-seq data
transformed_rnaseq_mat <- assay(vst_data)
```

We'll only display genes that are in the Hallmark E2F Targets leading edge subset, which we can access by name with `$` from our list of leading edge genes for pathways with significant, positive NES (`positive_leading_list`).
But, there's a problem: these are gene symbols and the row names of the transformed RNA-seq matrix are Ensembl gene IDs!
We used the `filtered_dge_df` data frame of statistics for our GSEA step itself and this data frame has both Ensembl gene IDs and gene symbols.
So we can use that to grab the Ensembl gene IDs that are in the leading edge for the Hallmark E2F Targets pathway.

```{r}
# Get the gene symbols in the leading edge for E2F target
e2f_gene_symbols <- gsea_results_df %>%
  dplyr::select(ID, core_enrichment) %>%
  dplyr::filter(ID == "HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS") %>%
  tidyr::separate_rows(core_enrichment, sep = "/") %>%
  dplyr::pull(core_enrichment)

e2f_ensg_ids <- filtered_dge_df %>%
  # Rows with gene symbols that are in the leading edge for E2F targets
  dplyr::filter(gene_symbol %in% e2f_gene_symbols) %>%
  # Get a vector of Ensembl gene IDs in that row where the names of the vector
  # are the corresponding gene symbol
  dplyr::pull(gene_id, name = gene_symbol)
```

Now subset the transformed RNA-seq matrix to the E2F targets leading edge genes only and z-score for display.

```{r}
# Use the Ensembl gene IDs to pull out the genes (rows) in the leading edge
e2f_mat <- transformed_rnaseq_mat[e2f_ensg_ids, ]
# "Convert" rownames to gene symbols using the names of the vector that contains
# the Ensembl gene identifiers
rownames(e2f_mat) <- names(e2f_ensg_ids)
# Calculate z-scores for display
e2f_mat <- (e2f_mat - rowMeans(e2f_mat)) / matrixStats::rowSds(e2f_mat)
```

We probably want to include the amplified, non-amplified status information as heatmap annotation.
Let's set that up in the next chunk.

```{r}
# We can snag the sample IDs and the status information from our DESeqTransform
# object
sample_annotation_df <- data.frame(
  sample_id = vst_data$names,
  status = vst_data$status
) %>%
  # But ComplexHeatmap wants the sample IDs as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("sample_id")

# The Okabe Ito palette is recommended for those with color vision deficiencies  
status_colors <- palette.colors(palette = "Okabe-Ito")[2:3]
sample_annotation_colors <- list(
  status = c(
    "Amplified" = status_colors[[1]],
    "Nonamplified" = status_colors[[2]]
  )
)

# Now to make the actual object we pass to Heatmap
column_annotation <- HeatmapAnnotation(
  df = sample_annotation_df,
  col = sample_annotation_colors,
  annotation_label = c("MYCN Status")
)
```

One thing to remember is that genes that contribute to an enrichment score won't _necessarily_ be significantly differentially expressed.
So let's add a _row annotation_ that includes the log2 fold change information because log2 fold change is how we rank genes for GSEA.

```{r}
row_annotation_df <- filtered_dge_df %>%
  # Rows with gene symbols that are in the leading edge for E2F targets
  dplyr::filter(gene_symbol %in% e2f_gene_symbols) %>%
  dplyr::select(gene_symbol, log2FoldChange) %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames("gene_symbol")

# To make a row annotation object, we use rowAnnotation()
row_annotation <- rowAnnotation(
  df = row_annotation_df,
  annotation_label = c("log2 fold change")
)
```

We can do something where we split our heatmap by a categorical variable.
Here we'd use status, but let's double check that our samples are in the same order in `sample_annotation_df` and the expression matrix.

```{r}
all.equal(colnames(e2f_mat), rownames(sample_annotation_df))
```

Okay, let's make our heatmap!

```{r}
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(e2f_mat,
                        # Add annotation bars to the top of the heatmap
                        top_annotation = column_annotation,
                        # Add annotation to the rows
                        right_annotation = row_annotation,
                        column_split = sample_annotation_df$status,
                        # This will be used as the label for the color bar
                        # of the cells of the heatmap itself
                        name = "z-score",
                        # Make the gene symbols smaller
                        row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 4),
                        # Make the sample names smaller
                        column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8),
                        # Display sample names on a 45 degree angle
                        column_names_rot = 45)
```
## Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
